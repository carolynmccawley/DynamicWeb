Midterm Project For Dynamic Web Fall 2018

For my midterm project, I created a Twitter Bot that searches and retweets funny tweets about astrology. 

I focused on tweets that were about astrology and involved keywords (some of which include: need, because, have) from an array. After running the bot a few times, I added a filtering element that searches for keywords within the tweets; if found, the tweet will not go live. 

The twitter bot tweets every hour.

To download and implement yourself:
1. add a config.js file in the same folder as the bot.js file that includes your twitter API keys and tokens
2. type in "npm install twit" into your terminal where bot.js is saved to download the package
