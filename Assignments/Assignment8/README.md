Assignment 8 -- Creating an App using Socket.io

This app allows whoever is on the page to communicate anyone else on the page. It tells the user how many people are online and their corresponding usernames. A user begins with the username Anonymous and then they are able to change it anytime. 

To download and implement this app: 
1. Download the repository
2. Install the following in your terminal where your js file is:
    
    npm install express
    npm install ejs
    npm install socket.io
    
Once everything is installed and set up, you can run the app in your terminal using node or nodemon. After, go to localhost/3000 and the user should see a chatbox and a page that tells them the number of users online, their usernames, and the abilty to change their username.
